        <p class = "huh3">I take this opportunity to welcome you to our website. I am glad you have taken keen interest in finding out and knowing more about Uganda Martyrs’ Secondary School Namugongo (UMSSN). There is no doubt; you won’t go wrong finding more about us. Bill Gates notes, information and technology and business are becoming inextricably interwoven. I don’t think that anybody can talk meaningfully about one without talking about the other.” UMSSN is very much aware of information and technology as a sine-quo-non to success, she is also aware that the world has become a global village.</p>
        <p class = "huh4">UMSSN is an education institution that is dedicated to providing a holistic education that is, producing academically sound, physically fit, socially balanced and God-fearing citizens. This is attained by putting emphasis on academics and co-curricular activities. I must say, I am proud to be associated with UMSSN, a school that is driven by her vision “To be a model school in the formation of God-fearing, academically excellent and responsible leaders.” We do our best to realize our dream and not just offer our vision lip-service; we do whatever it takes to walk the talk. As Headmaster, I must comment that much as we have keen interest in academics, we have also dedicated ourselves to those learning activities outside the classroom and of course not forgetting the welfare of every member of the community. It is important to note that to ensure effective running of co-curricular activities, different offices have been put in place at all levels, right from the headmaster’s office to the students’ prefectorate. There is a teacher in charge of all Co-curricular activities, the Director of Co-curricular activities, a Games master, Club patrons and Patrons of religious movements among others. At the students’ level we have students’ executives of different clubs and religious movements; we also have prefects in charge of sports and prefects in charge of Co-curricular activities. This structure of leadership has seen UMSSN excelling in Co-curricular activities. Another area for consideration is the spiritual welfare of the community. UMSSN’s success and progress is grounded on the belief. “The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom.” As members of UMSSN we consider ourselves to be born under lucky stars solely because our school sits on the holy grounds of the Uganda Martyrs. We never grow tired of praying through them to intercede for us. Our spiritual life and activities are centrally organized and facilitated by the school Chaplain; we count ourselves blessed to have a full time chaplain at campus. My dear visitor(s) once again allow me to express my heartfelt gratitude to you for taking off some time to find out and know more about UMSSN. Surely your knowledge about us adds color to who we are. May you be blessed.</p>
